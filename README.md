## Bot Configuration

To configure the bot, locate the `config.json` file in the project directory. Open it and edit the following parameters:

- **API Keys**: Input your API keys for the exchanges you want to trade on.
- **Trading Pairs**: Specify the trading pairs you want the bot to monitor.
- **Arbitrage Threshold**: Set the minimum price difference for the bot to execute trades.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "exchange_1": {
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
  },
  "exchange_2": {
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
  },
  "trading_pairs": ["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD"],
  "arbitrage_threshold": 0.5
}
```

## Trading Strategies

Crypto-Profit allows users to implement various trading strategies. Here are a few strategies you might consider:

### 1. Simple Arbitrage

This strategy involves buying an asset on one exchange where the price is lower and selling it on another exchange where the price is higher. The bot will execute these trades automatically when it detects a price difference that meets your set threshold.

### 2. Triangular Arbitrage

This strategy takes advantage of price differences among three currencies. The bot will buy and sell different pairs to profit from the discrepancies. This method can be more complex but offers higher potential returns.

### 3. Market Making

In this strategy, the bot places buy and sell orders to profit from the spread. It provides liquidity to the market and can generate profits from small price changes.

## YouTube Guide
